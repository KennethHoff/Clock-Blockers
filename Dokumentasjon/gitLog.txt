    Update Readme with an introduction to the main (currently working) features
    Add temporary targetFled condition (All it does is negate the result of the EnemySpotted condition)

    Added a few more AiController states, refined class accessibility, added a document describing some of my implementation details
    
    *Concrete class implementations are now internal, rather than Public
    * Changed the AStarPathFinder dictionary to use references rather than instanceIDs. (Was no reason to have it use IDs in the first place)
    * Slightly refactored 'Death logic'. Now is activated by the new 'Dead' State - more work is required.
    * New Word document that describes my usage of Internal/Public Class availability

    Movement Replication is now somewhat working
    
    *Fixed an infinite loop caused by looking for a path between the same marker (A -> A)

    Added multiStep pathfinding. However, it uses an exorbitant amount of memory, so I need to remove the Dictionary in the AStarPathfinder Class

    Gravity, Jumping and AI PathFollowing
    
    The implementation of 'jumping' needs to be though about. Currently it's jumping as as soon as it's colliding with anything on any side, so when he'll jump at every corner (as they hit the corner when they move)

    Reorganized the folder structure somewhat - The game can now be built.
    
    * Renamed the main assembly to 'ClockBlockers'
    * Moved all Editor scripts into a new Folder with their own Assembly 'Clockblockers.Editor'
    * Same, but with 'BetweenNames' assembly (Only used for the Property References for now)
    
    * Started working on the CharacterController again

    Refined Marker generation and adjacency
    
    * Markers are now named from top -> bottom rather now bottom -> top, if multiple are created on the same Y-axis
    * Markers now always connected to all adjacent nodes, regardless of height, and now allows for height-related checks post-mortum
    * Trying to create a path from one marker to another, via the Editor, now uses the grid's Default 'DefaultJumpHeight' field

    Added 'FindNearestMarker', but it required me to add 'IsTrigger' colliders to the markers, which is something I didn't want

    Refactored AStarPathfinding. Now uses Coroutines(So it no longer freezes), and can be set to show its search in the Editor

    Take two on the A* Pathfinder (Promptly called 'AStarPathFinderTwo').
    
    This works a lot more reliably, and better - actually gets the best path.
    
    This still has the same issues the last one has, except the most important one: It actually gets the (roughly.. some kinks still) path
    
    I also moved all NodeDictionary-related things into the A* PathFinder class itself; Wasn't needed in Grid after all.

    First version of A* Pathfinding
    
    There are 3 main problems with it so far:
    * It finds a valid path, but it's certainly not the fastest path. [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/513222373483347979/707702163337379920/unknown.png]
    * Each agent should have their own instance of the Pathfinding Class, as opposed to on the Grid itself as it is currently
    * It should be parallelized (Requires the previous point to be implemented)

    * Markers are now properly saved across Editor Reloads, as well as in the scene file

    Started work on the new replay system
    
    * Modularized the current replay system. Now runs off of interfaces rather than concrete implementation (.. Except for one thing, but I don't know how to do it, as they're fundamentally different)
    * Renamed a few things
    * And more

    Added a few things; Primarily improved accuracy of stored values.
    
    Added Targets to the Arena, to (manually) test consistency between actions(Player) and replays (Clones)
    
    Moved rotating back into Update, as opposed to FixedUpdate, as it made the camera feel unresponsive. No ill side effects.
    
    Dramatically improved accuracy of storage, as I made an oversight in implementation; Rotation values used was not capped at x decimal places as the rotation values stored were, so over time there was a decimal inconsistency.
